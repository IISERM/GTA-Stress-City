# Winners

The following are the winners of the event-

## MAIN QUEST:
- ### First Place: (4 hours, 40 mins)
Team "**prabhu-ke-kripa-ke-liye-chuchu-abhari**" - an MS17 team→
Achuthan, Abhishek Roy, Kripa Nath, Parbhat Kumar

- ### Second Place: (7 hours, 9 mins)
Team "**bananza-boys**" - an MS19 team→
Tushar Baruah, Pruthu Deshpande

- ### Third Place: (7 hours, 10 mins)
Team "**team-name**" - an MS21 team (who blew our minds, since they haven't even been to our campus yet but were able to pull through!)→
Ahir Ghosh, Abhilasha, Hanisha, Aryan

Deciding the winners for the second and third place was a close call. 6 teams were battling with last clue for the second place and one of them even had a 14 year old. This same team, quite impressively, solved 2 out of the 3 Labyrinth side quests.

## SIDE QUESTS:
- ### Side Quest 1: (2 hours, 20 mins)
Team "**ackerman-squad**" - an MS20 team→
Aswin R Nair, Adithyan V Kumar, Safana P Shaji, Arshita Dhiman

- ### Side Quest 2: (3 hours, 13 mins)
Team "**sussy-monke**" - an MS19 team→
Shantanu Raikwar, Aavani Babu, Prajakta Mane, Anish Koley

- ### Side Quest 3: (4 hours, 14 mins)
Team "**fuckboi-socrates**" - an MS20 "team"→
Sahil Shah

- ### LABYRINTH: (3 hours, 33 mins)
Team "**bananza-boys**"→
Yup, the same ones who came second in the main quest. (they were one of the two teams who obtained GODMODE from the labyrinth and speedran the rest of the game o_o)

You’re stressed, you don't know what to do, the world seems to spin and your life seems meaningless but there's no way out and nowhere to go. The path is riddled with obstacles.

# Prizes

All in all, we are giving away **7 prizes**.

## 1) Main Quest

The main quest follows a linear storyline, like a game, and **No Knowledge of Coding Is Required to Solve it**. There are 3 prizes-

1. First Prize:- **An Amazon Gift Card worth ₹800 and a goody**
2. Second Prize:- **An Amazon Gift Card worth ₹500**
3. Third Prize:- **An Amazon Gift Card worth ₹300**

## 2) Side Quests

There are 4 side quests in the game spread across the games, and there's a prize for each. The prize would go to the team solving them first-

1. Labyrinth Side Quest- **An Amazon Gift Card worth ₹500 and a goody**
2. Side Quest 1 - **An Amazon Gift Card worth ₹100 and a goody**
3. Side Quest 2 - **An Amazon Gift Card worth ₹100 and a goody**
4. Side Quest 3 - **An Amazon Gift Card worth ₹100 and a goody**

The Labyrinth Side Quest requires a **minimal** knowledge of coding to solve it. You need to know `loops` and `if-else`. The other 3 side quests require some knowledge about computers in general. 

A prize would be given to a team that completes a side quest first.

The side quests are independent of the main quest. You can win the main quest without having any knowledge of coding.
